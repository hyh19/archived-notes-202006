# Dart - Libraries

[Libraries and visibility | Language tour | Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#libraries-and-visibility)

> The `import` and `library` directives can help you create a modular and shareable code base. Libraries not only provide APIs, but are a unit of privacy: **identifiers that start with an underscore (_) are visible only inside the library**. Every Dart app is a library, even if it doesnâ€™t use a `library` directive.
