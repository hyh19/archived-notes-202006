# Dart - Instance variables

[Instance variables - Language tour | Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#instance-variables)

> All uninitialized instance variables have the value `null`.

> All instance variables generate an implicit getter method. Non-final instance variables also generate an implicit setter method.

> If you initialize an instance variable where it is declared (instead of in a constructor or method), the value is set when the instance is created, which is before the constructor and its initializer list execute.
