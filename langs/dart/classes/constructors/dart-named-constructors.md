# Dart - Named constructors

[Named constructors - Language tour | Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#named-constructors)

> Remember that constructors are not inherited, which means that a superclassâ€™s named constructor is not inherited by a subclass. If you want a subclass to be created with a named constructor defined in the superclass, you must implement that constructor in the subclass.
