# Dart - Abstract Class

[Interfaces and abstract classes - Language samples | Dart](https://dart.dev/samples#interfaces-and-abstract-classes)

> Dart has no `interface` keyword. Instead, all classes implicitly define an interface. Therefore, you can implement any class.

> Use the `abstract` modifier to define an abstract class—a class that can’t be instantiated. Abstract classes are useful for defining interfaces, often with some implementation. If you want your abstract class to appear to be instantiable, define a [factory constructor](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#factory-constructors).
