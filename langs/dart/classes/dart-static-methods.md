# Dart - Static methods

[Static methods - Language tour | Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#static-methods)

> Static methods (class methods) do not operate on an instance, and thus do not have access to `this`.

> Note: Consider using top-level functions, instead of static methods, for common or widely used utilities and functionality.
