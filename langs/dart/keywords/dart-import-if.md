# Dart - `import ... if ...`

[Conditionally importing and exporting library files](https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/create-library-packages#conditionally-importing-and-exporting-library-files)

> **Note**: The conditional import or export checks only whether the library is available for use on the current platform, not whether itâ€™s actually imported or used.

> All of the conditionally exported libraries must implement the same API.
