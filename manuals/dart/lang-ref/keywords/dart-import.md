# Dart - `import`

[Using libraries | Language tour | Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#using-libraries)

> The only required argument to `import` is a URI specifying the library. For built-in libraries, the URI has the special `dart:` scheme. For other libraries, you can use a file system path or the `package:` scheme. The `package:` scheme specifies libraries provided by a package manager such as the pub tool.
