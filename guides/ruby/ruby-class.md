# Ruby - Class

<https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/doc/syntax/modules_and_classes_rdoc.html#label-Classes>

> Every class is also a module, but unlike modules a class may not be mixed-in to another module (or class).

> If you do not supply a superclass your new class will inherit from [`Object`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Object.html).

> There is a special class [`BasicObject`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/BasicObject.html) which is designed as a blank class and includes a minimum of built-in methods.
