# [Clojure - Overview](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/clojure/clojure_overview.htm)

Clojure has the following high-level key objectives as a programming language.

- It is based on the LISP programming language which makes its code statements smaller than traditional programming languages.

- It is a functional programming language.

- It focuses on immutability which is basically the concept that you should not make any changes to objects which are created in place.

- It can manage the state of an application for the programmer.

- It supports concurrency.

- It embraces existing programming languages. For example, Clojure can make use of the entire Java ecosystem for management of the running of the code via the JVM.
