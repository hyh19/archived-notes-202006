# Dart - Async & Await

[Async | Language samples | Dart](https://dart.dev/samples#async)

> Avoid callback hell and make your code much more readable by using `async` and `await`.

[Asynchrony support | Language tour | Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#asynchrony-support)

> The `async` and `await` keywords support asynchronous programming, **letting you write asynchronous code that looks similar to synchronous code**.

[Asynchronous programming: futures, async, await | Dart](https://dart.dev/codelabs/async-await)

[Asynchronous programming: streams | Dart](https://dart.dev/tutorials/language/streams)

> A Future represents a computation that doesn’t complete immediately. Where a normal function returns the result, an asynchronous function returns a Future, which will eventually contain the result. The future will tell you when the result is ready.

> A stream is a sequence of asynchronous events. It is like an asynchronous Iterable—where, instead of getting the next event when you ask for it, the stream tells you that there is an event when it is ready.
